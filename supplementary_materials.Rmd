## LLM Ratings 

We used chatGPT to get sensitivity ratings for the questions above. Below, there is a reporoduction of the language we usted to prompt chatGPT for the ratings. 

Researcher (R): *Can I ask you to rate some texts?*

GPT (G): *Of course! I'd be happy to help you rate some texts. Please provide the texts you want me to evaluate, and let me know what criteria you'd like me to use for the rating.*

R: *OK I'd like you to rate to what extent each of the following questions is about a 'sensitive topic'. By 'sensitive topic' we mean subjects that individuals may not wish to talk openly about.  These can include subjects such as mental health, witchcraft accusations, racism, forced marriage, son preference, bodily mutilation, some aspects of religion, and violence. Do you understand what I mean by 'sensitive topic'?*

G: *Yes, I understand what you mean by a 'sensitive topic.' It refers to subjects that individuals may find uncomfortable, distressing, or taboo to discuss openly. These can encompass a wide range of topics, including mental health, witchcraft accusations, racism, forced marriage, son preference, bodily mutilation, certain aspects of religion, and violence. Please go ahead and provide the questions you'd like me to rate in terms of sensitivity.*

R: *Could you rate them on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means "not sensitive at all" and 10 means "extremely sensitive"?*

G: *Certainly! I can rate the questions on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means "not sensitive at all" and 10 means "extremely sensitive." Please provide the questions you'd like me to evaluate, and I'll rate them accordingly.*
