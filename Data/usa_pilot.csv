This research project aims to study how comfortable different people feel about discussing certain questions.  We will present you with certain questions that have been used in surveys in the past, and will ask you to tell us how comfortable you think most people from your country would feel with talking about those questions. The entire study should take approximately 15 minutes. 
Key Information: 
Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any point. However, you must answer all questions, perform all tasks, and proceed to the final screen of the study in order to be compensated. For successful participation in the study, you will receive $2.50, paid by transfer to your Prolific account.
We will adhere, at all times, to strict standards of confidentiality. Information obtained through your participation will be accessible only to the research team. Your name will not be attached to the data in any way. Although the data collected may be made public or used for future research, your identity will always remain confidential. 
You must be in the country specified during recruitment to qualify to participate in this study. If you are not, you will be redirected to the end of the survey after this page. Further, in accordance to Prolific policies, we may reject your work if the task was not completed correctly or the instructions were not followed. 
The questions that you will evaluate cover a range of topics, from childrearing to substance abuse. We will not ask you about your experiences or your opinion, but rather about how most people in your country would feel about discussing these topics. However, there is a risk that some questions might reference potentially sensitive topics. If this is in any way distressing, please feel free to abstain from participation. There are no direct benefits for participating in this research. 
If you have any questions you may contact us by email at sensitivityaroundtheglobe@gmail.com. If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, contact Duke University’s Campus Institutional Review Board at campusirb@duke.edu or at 919-684-3030 referencing protocol #2024-0223. 
By clicking “I agree to participate”, you indicate that you understand the study description above, that you understand the qualifications necessary to participate in this study, that you will follow the instructions, and that you agree to participate. You may save and/or print this form.","Unfortunately, you do not qualify for participation in this study. You have either indicated that you do not consent to participating in this study or your IP address does not match the locations to which the project is restricted. 
If you think this is an error, please feel free to reach out to us at sensitivityaroundtheglobe@gmail.com","Welcome, and thank you for deciding to take part in the study! Before you begin, please read the following instructions carefully:
In our everyday lives, there are topics we find easier or more difficult to discuss with others. In this project we will present you with a series of questions and you will tell us how difficult you think it would be for most people from your country to talk about these issues. Bear in mind we are not asking you about your comfort with discussing the topics. We instead want you to think about what most people in your country would feel like discussing those questions. 
Throughout the questions, you will be shown some active participation checks. They will consist of simple math operations – like 2+1 – that will help us know you are completing the task carefully. 
Please remember to read all questions and instructions carefully so that you respond to all participation checks correctly. Failing to do so will result in loss of payment.","What is your Prolific ID?

Specifically, we took questions that have been asked for several years in the World Values Survey ( https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp ) and asked you to tell us how most of your compatriots would feel about discussing them. We wanted to examine how sensitive these questions might be across different national contexts.
